Todo:
11. Understand how to read the stack trace when working with multiprocessing
8. Add memory usage monitoring
1. Go through and rename anything that makes the initial code easier to read (perhaps encoders should be _move_index_to_move and move_to_move_index



2. Write test suite 
4. Get more RAM - 192 48 X 4
5. BIOS update
6. Improve memory efficiency of simulation environments
7. Add logging to know what is happening

8. Figure out how to performance monitor
9. Figure out how to give more resources to WSL
10. Double check the handoff between the inference server and evaluate_node
11. Understand how to read the stack trace when working with multiprocessing
12.  Add early sanity checks (see claude) to make sure that things are actually progressing.
13. Wrap self play + train in loop so that it can run continuously during the day
14. Set up log storage and DB storage for workers
15. Improve the Queue process for efficiency




Currently:
History eats up 440 bytes
the children dict eats up 640 bytes
Best bet is to try and develop a lightweight chess library (with claudes help) that is memory efficient AND fast.  
History INCLUDES current position, but the encoding comment mentioned it shouldn't.  So which is it?
